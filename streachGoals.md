## What did this exercise teach you?
 
This exercise taught me the importance of commiting changes I make regularly. 
> When I first was learning how to type, I use to often forget to save my work. I recall how frustrating it was for all the work to be erased and having to start over. As new developments rolled out such as *Google Docs* and *Microsoft Word Auto Save*, I never had to worry about saving. 

Computers only know and will do what you tell them.
> It is important to take extra steps to rework code, check for bugs and errors.
