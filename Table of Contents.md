# Introduction
> Hi all, welcome to my page. My name is Theresa Walters. I am an MBA Canidate living in the beautiful PNW. I'm currently a student at CodeFellows excited to learn how to code and break into a new career path. Technology has always been an interest of mine and I am excited to learn and watch my experience level grow. For work, I am a project coordinator at a construction company, student outreach in higher education and an Officer in the Army Reserves. I am excited to continue on this journey with all of you.
